# Socket-Io-chat

My simple chat that I did by using socket technologi and using socket.io. To this small project I write backend and frontend.

## Description

This chat my homework that I got in Fullstack course. Itrying to get some specific result and check that all needed requirments. Some of them:

- The server will contain an array of all users currently logged in to chat.
- The server will notify all users of a user's login and logout.
- There will be a list on the chat side (frontend) which will contain the name of everyone who is currently logged in to the chat.
- When clicking on the name of a user who is currently logged in to the chat you will be given the option to send a specific message to that user only.

So my chat have some functionality and features that I decide to add:

- "typing ..." comment which sent to all online users(or to specific user if it is private message) when one of them types
- Private messages
